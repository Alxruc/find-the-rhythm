# find-the-rhythm

A small python program in which you can enter any public Spotify playlist URL and let the program play a random song from that playlist. Your goal then is to estimate the tempo (BPM) of the song. 

The BPM estimation is done through [Essentia](http://essentia.upf.edu) and working with Spotify Web API was made easier with the Spotipy library. Part of the GUI was generated by the Tkinter Designer

### How to start
Install the required python libaries by running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then create a .env file in the root of the directory containing your Spotify Client ID and Spotify Client Secret from the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) structured like this

```
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_ID_HERE
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_SECRET_HERE
```

Then simply run the main.py file with Python
